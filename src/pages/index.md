## What is LLMBoost?

LLMBoost is MangoBoostâ€™s enterprise-grade MLOps software platform designed to accelerate both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). It features patent-pending technologies for auto-tuning, model parallelism, batch scheduling, and memory optimizationâ€”enabling near-linear multi-node training scalability, as demonstrated in MLPerf Training v5.0 on AMD MI300X GPUs. LLMBoost also powers the highest MLPerf Inference v5.0 result in history for Llama2-70B in offline mode, showcasing its ability to deliver best-in-class inference performance. The platform is model-agnostic, hardware-flexible, and ready for deployment on public cloud or on-prem infrastructure.
